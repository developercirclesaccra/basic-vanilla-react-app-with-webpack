# Basic vanilla React app with Webpack

While create-react-app CRA is awesome for starter and small/hobby projects, it lacks some heavy production app features like CSS preprocessors (Sass, LESS, CSS Modules).

To use these and other custom config, one would need to eject an app created using CRA. This is where confusion begins for most beginners. Also, dealing with Webpack config can sometimes be a headache.

That is why I've built this to help me start off a project I'll have to potentially eject if I were using CRA. Hope it is useful for you.

## To use

* Clone repo
* Install dependencies
* Run `npm run dev` and your app will be available at _http://localhost:8080/_
